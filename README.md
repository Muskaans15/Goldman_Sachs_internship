## Password Controls and Security Policies

### Overview 
As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach.

`What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?`

`What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?`

`What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?`
Here is a sample data file containing hashes dumped together:
